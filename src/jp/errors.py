"""Exception hierarchy and exit codes for jp.

Exit codes (see docs/architecture.md):
    0   success
    1   generic / unexpected error
    2   usage error (bad CLI args)
    3   not inside a jp repo / config problem
    4   authentication problem (missing/invalid token)
    5   network / API transport problem
    6   safety refusal (path-jail, bad prefix, conflict abort, ...)
    7   partial failure (run completed but some files failed)

All jp-raised errors derive from ``JpError`` and carry an ``exit_code`` so the
CLI dispatcher can translate them into the correct process exit status.

Security note: error *messages* are always passed through ``ui.redact`` at the
boundary (see cli.py); no module should embed a raw token in a message.
