"""Path safety layer -- the #1 security boundary of jp (see docs/architecture.md).

This module is the *only* place allowed to translate between local filesystem
paths and remote Contents-API paths, and it is the gatekeeper for every
mutating remote call. The threat model is a SHARED machine and a possibly
hostile remote server, so the rules are strict and intentionally paranoid:

  * ``normalize_rel``      -- collapse a user/local path to a safe POSIX
                              relative path; reject anything that escapes.
  * ``validate_prefix``    -- reject empty / root / "shared"-like prefixes.
  * ``remote_path_for``    -- compose prefix + rel into the API path.
  * ``assert_within_prefix`` -- MUST be called IMMEDIATELY before every
                              PUT/PATCH/DELETE. Uses a trailing-slash compare,
                              NEVER a bare ``startswith(prefix)``.
  * ``safe_local_dest``    -- sanitize a name/path coming FROM the server
                              (anti Zip-Slip / CWE-22) before we ever write it.
  * ``atomic_write``       -- write-to-temp-then-rename, refusing to follow
                              symlinks, so a planted symlink can't redirect a
                              write outside the working tree.
  * ``find_root``          -- locate the repo root (dir containing ``.jp``).

Nothing the path layer produces for the remote may start with a dot, and our
temporary remote dir is ``jp-tmp`` (no leading dot) on purpose (see docs/architecture.md).
