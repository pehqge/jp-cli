# Command reference

All commands accept the global flags `-q/--quiet` and `--no-color`. Run
`jp <command> --help` for the full option list of any command.

## Workspace

### `jp clone <url> [dir]`
Create a new local workspace from a remote Jupyter folder and download its tree.
The URL is the one from your browser's address bar, e.g.
`https://host/user/<name>/lab/tree/<folder>`; `tree`, `doc/tree`, `notebooks`,
named servers and standalone servers are also understood. Alternatively pass
`--base-url <api-base>` and `--prefix <remote-path>` explicitly. `--credential
<name>` picks a saved credential (see `jp login`); if omitted, jp uses the only
one or prompts you to choose. `--token-path` records a token file directly.
`--dry-run` previews without writing.

The clone **refuses** a prefix that resolves to the server root or a shared
directory (e.g. `compartilhado`, `lapix`), so a workspace can never point at
everyone's data.

### `jp init <url>`
Turn the current directory into a jp workspace without downloading anything
(useful for a first push of an existing local folder). Same URL / `--base-url` +
`--prefix` forms as `clone`.

### `jp login`
Save a **named credential** for a server, interactively. It explains how to get a
JupyterHub API token, prompts you to paste it (hidden, via `getpass`), asks for a
name (e.g. `myserver`), and asks whether to save it **global** (everywhere) or
**local** (this workspace only). The token value is written to a private `0600`
file and registered for redaction; it is never echoed and never written into
`.jp/config.json`. Run it repeatedly to store several servers.

Scriptable flags: `--name <name>`, `--global`/`--local` (local requires a
workspace), `--token-stdin` (read the value from stdin), `--token-path <file>`
(register an existing token file), `--force` (overwrite an existing name).

Token resolution at sync time: `$JP_TOKEN` → `$JP_TOKEN_FILE` → the recorded
credential (local registry before global) → legacy `token_path` → legacy
`~/.config/jp/token`.

## Synchronization

### `jp status`
Show, read-only, how the working tree differs from the last synced state and the
remote: added, modified, conflicting, and skipped (hidden) files. Never writes.

### `jp pull [path...]`
Download remote changes into the working tree. Additive by default — **never
deletes** a local file. A true three-way conflict (both sides changed) aborts
that file instead of overwriting your local copy. `--dry-run` previews.

### `jp push [path...]`
Upload local changes to the remote. Additive by default — **never deletes** a
remote file. Hidden files (dotfiles) are skipped and reported (the server
rejects them) without aborting the run. Conflicts abort that file rather than
overwriting a newer remote version. `--dry-run` previews.

### Mirror mode (`--mirror` / config `mirror`)
By default, sync is additive. With mirror mode on, `push`/`pull` additionally
*offer to delete* files that exist on one side but not the other:

- `push --mirror` — remote files with no local counterpart become deletion candidates.
- `pull --mirror` — local files with no remote counterpart become deletion candidates.

Deletion is **never silent**. In a terminal jp shows a keep/delete selector
(arrow keys; every file defaults to keep) and deletes only what you mark. With
`--yes` it deletes all candidates (for scripts). In a non-interactive shell
without `--yes`, it deletes nothing and lists what it would have offered.
Persist the setting with `jp config set mirror true`, or use `--mirror` /
`--no-mirror` for a single run.

### `jp diff [path...]`
Show file-level differences between the local copy and the last synced state
(and the remote with `--remote`).

## Notebooks

### `jp kernel`
Set up a VS Code **remote** Jupyter kernel so notebooks run in the right
directory. When VS Code runs a local `.ipynb` against a remote kernel, the
kernel's working directory is the server's home, not the notebook's folder, so
relative paths (`pd.read_excel("dataset/x.xlsx")`) raise `FileNotFoundError`;
VS Code's `notebookFileRoot` does not apply to remote kernels.

`jp kernel` does **not** touch the remote. It prints a one-time IPython startup
snippet — pre-filled with this workspace's local root and `prefix` — and copies
it to your clipboard. You paste it into one cell, run it once, and restart the
kernel; every notebook in the workspace then starts in the correct directory
automatically. By default the snippet is only copied (kept out of the output);
`--script` prints it, and `--no-clipboard` skips copying.

`--link` instead shows and copies the **server connection URL** (with your
token) to paste into VS Code's kernel picker. This is the one command that
prints your token, so it is opt-in and asks for confirmation first (`-y/--yes`
skips the prompt); treat the URL like a password.

Must be run inside a workspace. See
[vscode-remote-cwd.md](vscode-remote-cwd.md) for the full walkthrough, including
how to connect VS Code to the remote kernel.

## Remote shell

### `jp terminal`
Turn your local terminal into the **remote machine's shell**, in one command and
with no setup. It creates an ephemeral Jupyter terminal on the server (the same
thing the web UI's "New → Terminal" opens), connects to it, and proxies your
terminal to it — so you get a real, interactive remote shell, starting in this
workspace's mapped folder.

It is intentionally narrow and safe on a shared server: the **only** remote calls
it makes are creating and deleting an ephemeral terminal session
(`POST`/`DELETE /api/terminals`). It never reads, writes, moves, or deletes a
file, and the session it creates is always deleted on exit (only that session,
never anyone else's). The token is sent only in the `Authorization` header on the
websocket handshake, never in a URL.

- `--no-cd` starts in the server's default directory instead of the workspace
  folder.
- `-y/--yes` skips the one-time confirmation prompt.
- Press **Ctrl-]** to force-disconnect (telnet convention) if the remote shell
  ever wedges; `exit`/Ctrl-D end it normally.
- The websocket client is hand-rolled on the standard library, so `jp` keeps its
  zero-dependency promise.
- Requires a POSIX terminal (`termios`). On Windows there is no raw PTY, so the
  command falls back to opening the Jupyter web UI (use New → Terminal there);
  that fallback shows a token-bearing URL and asks for confirmation first.
- Needs server-side terminals to be enabled (most Jupyter Server / Lab
  deployments enable them by default); if they are disabled, `jp terminal` says
  so and exits without creating anything.

Must be run inside a workspace.

### `jp run <file> [args…]`
Run a **local** script on the remote machine in the folder you're currently in —
without `jp push`-ing it first. It's the fast loop for "edit locally, run
remotely": ideal when you're iterating on a script in your editor against a
remote kernel/box.

How it works, and why it looks exactly like a local run:
- Your file's *source* is uploaded to a temp file named
  `__temp__.<name>.<random>.<ext>` **in the mapped folder for your current
  directory** (workspace root → `<prefix>`, a subfolder → `<prefix>/<subfolder>`).
  Being in that folder gives the script the same working directory, `sys.path`,
  and relative-`open()` behavior as a local run. It is removed as soon as the
  program exits.
- For a **Python** file, a tiny bootstrap runs the source under the real name, so
  `sys.argv[0]`, `__file__`, and tracebacks show `train.py` — not the temp file —
  exactly like a local run. (Shebang scripts and non-Python interpreters show the
  temp name; a minor cosmetic difference.)
- The program runs inside a one-shot ephemeral terminal (like `jp terminal`)
  whose command brackets the output with two unique marker control-sequences
  (the FinalTerm / iTerm2 shell-integration technique). The client swallows the
  shell prompt and the echoed command (everything before the start marker) and
  stops at the end marker, which carries the exit code; the session then `exit`s,
  so no prompt is shown before or after. You see only the program's output —
  streamed live — never the remote shell.
- The remote PTY echoes typed input, so `input()` behaves exactly like local
  (what you type appears as you type it); Ctrl-C is forwarded to the program.
- The exit code is propagated to `jp run` (so `jp run x.py && …` works).

Safety / correctness:
- **Never overwrites or deletes your data.** The temp name carries 128 bits of
  randomness and is pre-checked for existence on the remote before upload;
  cleanup deletes exactly that one file. No directory is ever created or removed,
  so concurrent `jp run`s in different terminals can't clash. (The `__temp__.`
  name is *not* hidden — the Contents API rejects dotfiles by default — but it is
  auto-ignored by `jp` and removed right after the run.)
- The interpreter is chosen from the file's **shebang**, else its **extension**
  (`.py`→`python3`, `.sh`→`bash`, `.js`→`node`, `.rb`→`ruby`, `.R`→`Rscript`, …),
  else `--as <interp>`.
- Any **data files** the script opens must already exist on the remote — `jp run`
  only ships the script itself; `jp push` the data first.

Flags:
- `--as <interp>` forces the interpreter (e.g. `--as python3` for an
  extensionless file).
- `--dry-run` prints the target folder, interpreter, and source without running
  anything (and without creating a terminal).

Requires a POSIX terminal (`termios`); macOS and Linux today. Windows support
arrives together with the `jp terminal` Windows fix. Must be run inside a
workspace (there is no URL mode).

## Inspection & configuration

### `jp ls [remote-path]`
List a remote directory through the Contents API without touching local disk.

### `jp config`
With no arguments, opens an interactive settings editor (arrow keys to move,
Space to change a value, `i` for help on the selected setting, `/` to search,
Enter to save, Esc to cancel). In a non-interactive shell it prints the current
settings instead. Scriptable forms:

```
jp config list
jp config get <key>
jp config set <key> <value>
```

Editable settings: `mirror`, `dotfiles`, `color`, `timeout`. Connection fields
(`base_url`, `prefix`, `token_path`) are shown for context and settable via
`jp config set`.

### `jp ignore [pattern...]`
Add or list `.jpignore` patterns (gitignore-style). Always-on ignores include
`.jp/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.pyc`.

### `jp doctor`
Diagnose your setup: token present and valid, server reachable, server running
(vs. stopped), and clock sanity. Prints actionable hints.

### `jp update`
Update jp to the latest version. Detects whether jp was installed via pipx, uv,
or pip and upgrades in place; for a standalone binary it prints the reinstall
command. `jp update --check` only reports whether a newer release exists.

### `jp version`
Print the jp version. Also available as `jp --version`.

## Deletion (gated)

### `jp rm <path>`
The **only** command that deletes on the remote outside of mirror mode, and it
is intentionally hard to misuse:

- the path is validated against the workspace prefix immediately before the call;
- it prints a dry-run of exactly what will be removed (`--dry-run` stops there);
- it requires a typed confirmation (or `--yes` in scripts; a non-interactive
  shell without `--yes` refuses);
- `--recursive` is required to remove a non-empty directory, and removal then
  proceeds bottom-up (the server does not delete recursively);
- `--local` also removes the local copy of a single file.

> On many JupyterHub deployments a remote delete moves the file to a trash
> folder rather than erasing it, and can leave the parent listing in a bad
> state — one more reason `push`/`pull` never delete by default.
